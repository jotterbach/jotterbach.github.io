* What defines a currency?
* What is a commodity?
* [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp#axzz2CqfsX9BD): Some currencies, like cryptocurrencies​, bitcoin​, dogecoin​ and other online currencies and branded currencies are not tied to any country. Branded currencies, like airline and credit card points, or in-game credits are valued in relationship to the value of the products or services they’re tied to. Control over digital currencies is entirely decentralized, and the exchange rate of a digital currency can vary widely in a short period of time. 
* What's the market for 'personal data'? It's the price for "free" internet, e.g. free social media platforms, free news, pirate sites .... But also non-free/subsidized/convenience services, e.g. amazon, netflix, lending (no explicit ads, but implicit usage statistics)
