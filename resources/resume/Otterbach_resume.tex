\section{\color{ResumeBlue}PROFILE}
Self-motivated Ph.D.-level Physicist \& Data Scientist with a curious, analytical mind and a passion for data. Experience managing and analyzing data using Python (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn), Apache Spark (SparkSQL, MLlib), Postgres, MATLAB, {\sc Mathematica} and familiarity with R. Extensive experience with advanced mathematics, statistics and machine learning, as well as presenting and visualizing complex concepts to diverse audiences.

\section{\color{ResumeBlue}PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT}
{\bf Data Scientist} \hfill8/2015 - present \\
{\it LendUp, San Francisco, CA}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Architect for new machine learning model scoring service with ability to serve models built in several different languages and frameworks.
  \item Implemented a Python variation of a learning algorithm for Generalized Additive Models.
  \item Contributed to key algorithms to generate model insights and auditability.
  \item Supported Data Scientists with ad-hoc and production algorithms for feature analysis and selection. Provided dashboards and automated reports for business stakeholders.
  \item Developed and deployed several models for underwriting, including models for new products.
  \item Analysed and integrated new data sources into production systems to increase data redundancy.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Infrastructure Quality Engineer} (Machine Learning)\hfill4/2014 - 7/2015 \\
{\it Palantir Technologies, London, UK (until 1/2015) and Palo Alto, CA}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Analyzed TB-sized, disparate customer-dataset and implemented new propensity model pipeline using Apache Spark, surfacing previously unknown churn indicators.
  \item Solidified and scaled end-to-end PySpark ETL-machine learning pipeline, resulting in a $\sim$5x increase in handled data-scale and $\sim$5x decrease of training time.
  \item Reduced productization times of new machine learning product features by 3x by creating new featurization prototypes in quick iterations with product and data-science teams.
  \item Deployed, debugged and maintained complex, distributed software stacks, containing Apache Spark, Hadoop HDFS and IPython Notebook servers, on cloud-based AWS systems. Optimized the stacks for best computational performance and stability.
  \item Developed CometD-based user-scale testing and analytics framework resulting in a $\sim$10x improvement in handled users.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Postdoctoral Research Fellow} (Theoretical Quantum Physics)\hfill 9/2011 - 3/2014 \\
{\it Harvard Quantum Optics Center, Cambridge, MA}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simulated the time-evolution of models with spatial and temporal randomness using Markov processes and ensemble theory, creating insights into highly correlated matter.
  \item Explained experimental observations using fitted statistical simulations and analytic solutions.
  \item Applied mathematical and analytical tools to compare simulated predictions to exact solutions of the model's differential equations and visualized the results.
  \item Presented research results to general as well as expert audiences through invited seminars, conferences, talks and posters.
  \item Collaborated, influenced and contributed to research projects with international teams.
\end{itemize}
