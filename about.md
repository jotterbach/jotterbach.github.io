Hej there!

Here's some brief information about me. After finishing a Ph.D. in Quantum Physics with M. Fleischhauer at the [University of Kaiserslautern](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer) (Germany), I spent some time as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Harvard Quantum Optics Center](http://hqoc.harvard.edu/) continuing my research of [Single- and Many-Body Phenomena of Dark-State Polaritons](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=theses:otterbach2011_phd_thesis.pdf). During that time I became increasingly interested in the potentials of “Big Data” and “Data Analytics” with ever-improving computational power. I accepted a job at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com) as an Infrastructure Quality Engineer to better understand what drives this new technology. Equipped with these experiences I then returned closer to my roots as a Scientist and Modeller and am currently working as a Data Scientist at [LendUp](https://www.lendup.com). Here I tackle the various data problems that financial startups in the loan sector encounter, leveraging the latest Big Data Technologies such as Apache Spark, Amazon Redshift, and other analytic Open Source tools such as Jupyter and Postgres.

I spend my free time pondering other statistical, computational, physics-related, and Machine Learning problems and enjoying the California outdoors.
