Hej there!

Since you found your way here, I give you some short information about myself: After finishing a Ph.D. in Quantum Physics with M. Fleischhauer at the [University of Kaiserslautern](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer), I spend some time as a PostDoc at the [Harvard Quantum Optics Center](http://hqoc.harvard.edu/) continuing my PhD studies of [Single- and Many-Body Phenomena of Dark-State Polaritons](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=theses:otterbach2011_phd_thesis.pdf).
During that time I became increasingly interested in the potentials of "Big Data" and "Data Analytics" with the advent of improving compitational power. I decided to [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com) as an Infrastructure Quality Engineer to better understand what powers the new technology. Equipped with these experiences I then returned closer to my 'roots' as a Scientist and Modeller and am currently working as a Data Scientist at [LendUp](https://www.lendup.com). Here I tackle the various data problems that financial startups in the loan sector encounter leveraging the latest "Big Data Technology" such as Apache Spark, Amazon Redshift and using other analytic Open Source tools such as Jupyter and Postgres.

Apart from that I am always interested in statistical, computational, physics-related and Machine Learning problems and spend my free time pondering about these and enjoying the California outdoors.
