Hej there!

Here's some brief information about me. After finishing a Ph.D. in Quantum Physics with M. Fleischhauer at the [University of Kaiserslautern](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer) (Germany), I spent some time as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Harvard Quantum Optics Center](http://hqoc.harvard.edu/) continuing my research of [Single- and Many-Body Phenomena of Dark-State Polaritons](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=theses:otterbach2011_phd_thesis.pdf). During that time I became increasingly interested in the potentials of “Big Data” and “Data Analytics” with ever-improving computational power. I accepted a job at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com) as an Infrastructure Quality Engineer to better understand what drives this new technology. Equipped with these experiences I returned closer to my roots as a Scientist and Modeller as a Data Scientist at [LendUp](https://www.lendup.com) tackling various data problems encountered by financial startups in the loan sector. This was followed by a brief round-trip back to physics at the Quantum Computing startup [Rigetti](http://rigetti.com/) as a Quantum and Software Engineer developing algorithms for Quantum Control and Applications. Now, I work at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com) to ensure that future Artifical Intelligence systems stay aligned with human values and incentives.

I spend my free time pondering other statistical, computational, physics-related, and Machine Learning problems and enjoying the California outdoors.
