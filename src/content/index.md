Hej there!

After finishing a Ph.D. in Quantum Physics with M. Fleischhauer at the [University of Kaiserslautern](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer) (Germany), I spent some time as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Harvard Quantum Optics Center](http://hqoc.harvard.edu/) continuing my research of [Single- and Many-Body Phenomena of Dark-State Polaritons](http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/agfleischhauer/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=theses:otterbach2011_phd_thesis.pdf). During that time I became interested in the potentials of Big Data and Data Analytics. I accepted a job at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com) as an Infrastructure Engineer to learn the fundamentals of these technologies. Equipped with these experiences, I returned closer to my research roots as a Data Scientist at [LendUp](https://www.lendup.com) tackling data problems encountered by financial startups in the loan sector, followed by a brief round-trip back to physics at the Quantum Computing startup [Rigetti](https://rigetti.com/) as a Quantum and Software Engineer. Now, I work at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com) to ensure that future Artifical Intelligence systems stay aligned with human values and incentives.

I spend my free time pondering other statistical, computational, physics-related, and Machine Learning problems and enjoying the California outdoors.
