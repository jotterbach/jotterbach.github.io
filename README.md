# Repository of Johannes' Blog

The default branch is `develop` as GH-pgaes requires user pages to be deployed from `master`.

## Running the local development

Run the following commands
  - `npm install`
  - `gatsby develop`

## Deploying the page

It uses Gatsby's [gh-pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/). Run
`npm run deploy`
